WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal Eight_CE connected to top level port Eight_CE has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal btn_Memory connected to top level port btn_Memory
   has been removed.
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:249 - The following adjacent carry multiplexers occupy different
   slice components.  The resulting carry chain will have suboptimal timing.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_142/XLXI_77/rowON is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           252 out of   1,920   13%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               686 out of   1,920   35%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            411 out of     960   42%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     411 out of     411 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     411   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         752 out of   1,920   39%
    Number used as logic:               686
    Number used as a route-thru:         66

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 43 out of      83   51%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     5 out of      24   20%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.81

Peak Memory Usage:  329 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
